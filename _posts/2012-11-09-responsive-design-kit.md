Although I agree with Ethan Marcotte in regards to how the different breakpoints should be added to your project, sometimes you just need to target specific devices.

- Chris Coyier as got your back with [Media queries for standard devices](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)

While the W3c Group is working hard to figure out responsive images the following approaches will take you a long way.

*Remember the design should always dictate the breakpoints and not the other way around.*

I must say I completely agree with Joni Korpi on this post [Leaving old IE behind](http://www.jonikorpi.com/leaving-old-IE-behind/). 

The Mobile first approach allows you to make a clean break with legacy browsers, by simply not wrapping the narrower design inside a media query.
