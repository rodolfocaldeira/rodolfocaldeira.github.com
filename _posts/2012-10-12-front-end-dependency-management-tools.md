They just keep on coming - [Jam](http://jamjs.org/) is another package manager for JavaScript. A full in depth tutorial can be found in the [JavaScript Playground - Package Management with Jam](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/07/package-management-with-jam-js).

If you are looking for something even simpler, Jack Franklin has come up with [Nodefetch](https://github.com/jackfranklin/nodefetch) that can easily download you the latest version of your favorite library.
