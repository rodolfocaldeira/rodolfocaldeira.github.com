Today I have two more additions to this list.

- [CSS A to Z](http://cssaz.tumblr.com/), really cool a to z animations using css.
- [CSS Shake](http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/csshake/) it is a collection of animations that can be used to achieve a shaking effect.

Please enjoy.

CSS animations when used in the right context can turn a dull website or application into a memorable experience.

- [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) a library of ready to use css animations
- [Animation Generator](http://coveloping.com/tools/css-animation-generator) an easy way to apply some of Dane's animations
- [Hover](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) a lot of different ways of making your website call to action more noticeable

Please remember not to go overboard, too much of anything is never good.
