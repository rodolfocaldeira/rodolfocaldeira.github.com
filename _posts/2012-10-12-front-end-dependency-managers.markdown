The name says it all a dependency manager is responsible for managing your modules and resolving your dependencies. 
Completely analogous to what npm is for node.js or gem for ruby.

Let computers do what they are good doing so that you can focus on what is important.
Let the ecosystem of tiny javascript decoupled modules flourish.
