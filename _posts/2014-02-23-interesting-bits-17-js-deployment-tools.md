A couple of years ago Fabric and Capistrano were the only serious options for automating the deployment of your applications.

Fast forward a couple of years and we now start to see mature alternatives in the JavaScript sphere.

Please find below some of those alternatives:

- [Flightplan](https://github.com/pstadler/flightplan)
- [Deploy](https://github.com/visionmedia/deploy)
- [Gulp SSH](https://github.com/teambition/gulp-ssh)
- [Grunt FTP Deploy](https://github.com/zonak/grunt-ftp-deploy)

If you want to learn more about all the other options out there, Chris Coyer has written down a brilliant overview which you should read [Website Deployment: Let Us Count The Ways!](http://css-tricks.com/deployment/).

JavaScript all the way.
