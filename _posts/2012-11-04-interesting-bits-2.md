Where are a couple of really interesting bits I have collected in the last couple of weeks.

- [Prose.io](http://prose.io) is a web-based interface for managing text-based content in your GitHub repositories
- [WebZap](http://webzap.uiparade.com/) is a Photoshop plugin that allows you to prototype ideas. It has a set of components that you can easily use to mock up an idea in just a few minutes
- [NetTuts - Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course/) a free course from Jeffrey Way that teaches you everything that you need to know about this powerful tool
- [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) this one is an oldie but it makes a lot of sense, if you use Git you should definitely give this work flow a try
- [HTML5 Polyfills](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills) because sometimes graceful degradation is not an option
- [Scaling your JavaScript Applications](http://addyosmani.com/scalable-javascript-videos/) Addy Osmani presents a set of design guidelines that you can use today to bulletproof your JavaScript applications for tomorrow 
- [Require.js 2.0 Delayed Module Evaluation and Google Maps](http://blog.millermedeiros.com/requirejs-2-0-delayed-module-evaluation-and-google-maps/) a really interesting article about version 2.0 of Require.js

I'm telling you all this Internet thing is going to be big.
