title: Interesting Bits 9 - Sketch App
excerpt: A tiny yet powerful vector tool.
---

In the last couple of weeks I've been using a lot the [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) app from Bohemian Coding and I must say I really like it.

For me the selling points of this app are:

- a vector tool that is less than â‚¬50
- svg support
- infinite canvas workflow
- it is death simple to put something up very quickly

I definitely recommend you trying out the app (check the trial available in the website) and see what you can do with it.

To help you out and give you some ideas of what you can do here are some Sketch resources:
