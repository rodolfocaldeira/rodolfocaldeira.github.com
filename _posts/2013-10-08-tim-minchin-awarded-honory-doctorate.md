Tim Minchin was awarded an honorary doctorate by The University of Western Australia and gave this very funny and inspiring speech.

Here are some of my favourite passages 

> The Arts and Sciences need to work together to improve how knowledge is communicated.

> You will soon be dead. Life will sometimes seem long and tough and tiring. And sometimes will be happy and sometimes sad, and then you'll be old and then you'll be dead. There is only one sensible thing to do with this empty existence and that is fill it. 

> Life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can.
