title: Screen Hue
excerpt: Playing around with socket.io.
---

This week after watching the promo for [Hue](http://www.meethue.com/en-US/getstarted) a new product from Philips I decided to hack something very quickly with Node.js and Socket.io.

The result is [Screen Hue](https://github.com/rodolfocaldeira/screen-hue), one of the most anticipated real time web apps of the year... well not really, but it was something fun to do.

You can see it in action in this [video](http://telly.com/R692K) or check the code on [Github](https://github.com/rodolfocaldeira/screen-hue).

Just in time for Christmas â˜ƒ.
