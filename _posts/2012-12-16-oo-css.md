title: Object Oriented CSS
excerpt: Keep the complexity of your css down.
---

Last year after reading the "smacks" book my approach to how I would structure a stylesheet completely changed.

Using an object oriented and modular approach on my stylesheets allowed me keep complex projects very tight and organized as well as with a minimum number of styles.

The [Goodyear Truck website](http://www.goodyear.eu/home_en/tires/truck/) is a good example of that.

If you do any kind of front end development this is without a doubt a new religion, that you should embrace.
