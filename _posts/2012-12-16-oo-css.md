title: Object Oriented CSS
excerpt: Keep the complexity of your css down.
---

Last year after reading the "smacks" book my approach to how I would structure a stylesheet completely changed.

Using an object oriented and modular approach on my stylesheets allowed me keep complex projects very tight and organized as well as with a minimum number of styles.

The [Goodyear Truck website](http://www.goodyear.eu/home_en/tires/truck/) is a good example of that.

If you do any kind of front end development this is without a doubt a new religion, that you should embrace.

An interesting article from Nicolas Gallagher on [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/w3conf-nicolas-gallagher-questioning-best-practices/) that raises an interesting point in terms of the current best practices for naming css classes and selectors. 

Nicolas says that the *hyphenated-lowercase-4-life* approach is pretty much the standard these days, but he suggests something slightly different.

{% highlight css %}
.Button {}
.ButtonGroup {}
.Button--primary {}
.ButtonGroup-item {}
{% endhighlight %}  

> This naming convention communicates much more. Double dashes are a modifier. Single dashes is a component child.

Although it looks a little bit weird, what he's saying makes actually a lot of sense. It would be very interesting to create a fork of [Twitter BootStrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) using this class naming convention.
