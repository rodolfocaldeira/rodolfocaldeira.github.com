I'm very happy to start seeing some work being done in the front-end dependency management area.

The name says it all a dependency management tool is responsible for managing your modules and resolving your dependencies. 

Completely analogous to what npm is for node.js or gem for ruby.

Let computers do what they are good doing so that you can focus on what is important.

The ecosystem of tiny javascript decoupled modules can now flourish.
