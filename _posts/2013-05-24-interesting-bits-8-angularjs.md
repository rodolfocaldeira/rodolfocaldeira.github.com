**Update: 2014/02/21**

Today I had a chance to look at this extensive list and decided to moved it into Delicious, because that is why we have bookmark managers.

Over the next couple of days I'll be moving the rest, and will be creating the a list with the best resources.

Without further ado let me introduce you the [AngularJs bundle](https://delicious.com/rodolfocaldeira/tag_bundle/AngularJs).

You may have noticed that Google's [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/) superheroic framework is getting very popular these days.

In my opinion the main reason for that is because it enables you to build anything you want very quickly. There's absolutely no boilerplate code whatsoever, you write declarative code that behaves like it should, everything is very straightforward.

I'm just starting to learn more about this framework and how to use it, and since I've been reading a lot about it in a lot of different websites, I've decided to gather all of those links in this post.

So, without any further ado here's the extensive list.
