title: Interesting Bits 3
---

Just a few more days to go before Christmas, but we still have time for some interesting bits.


## Icon Fonts

GitHub was the first one, now font icons are everywhere.

- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) by GitHub
- [Fontello](http://fontello.com/), icon fonts generator 
- [IcoMoon](http://icomoon.io/app/), also a generator

*Update December, 20th 2012*

- [The Big List of Flat Icons & Icon Fonts](http://css-tricks.com/flat-icons-icon-fonts/) by Chris Coyer

## Tools

What would we do without them.

- [Wireframe.cc](http://wireframe.cc/), a nice little app for minimal wireframes
- [PopApp](http://popapp.in/), prototype in paper - brilliant concept
- [Slicy](http://macrabbit.com/slicy/), slicing psds can be fun
- [Texture generator](http://www.noisetexturegenerator.com), who needs Photoshop
- [0to255](http://0to255.com/) find variations of any colour
- [Google Maps Custom Marker Maker](http://www.powerhut.co.uk/googlemaps/custom_markers.php), I've used this generator so many times that I lost track, ‚ù§ it


##  Node Modules

A couple of Node modules that I found interesting, and that I'm eager to use in the future.

- [Node Romulus](https://github.com/felixge/node-romulus), static website generator - just like Jekyll but written in Node.js
- [Wizardy](http://diy.github.com/wizardry/), image processor
- [SSH client](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2)

All the best.
