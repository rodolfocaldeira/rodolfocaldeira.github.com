If you have some time to kill, don't forget to watch the following documentaries:

- [Machead](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379667/) for Apple fanboys
- [The Dungeon Masters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988086/) for D&D players
- [Modify](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455980/) enhancing your body

Last night I got the chance to see [Indie Game: The Movie](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/) and it would be wrong not to mention this one. It's definitely worth it.
