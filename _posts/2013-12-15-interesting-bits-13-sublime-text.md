Sublime Text has revolutionized the landscape of text editors over the last couple of years.
This editor is highly customizable, available in all the major OSs (Mac, Linux and Windows) and it has a plugin architecture that allows you, as well as the community to extend its default behavior. 

This editor ticks pretty much all the requirements needed for making into a Developer's toolbox and I think that is why, it has become so much popular.

Please find below some articles that will help you customize Sublime Text even further and take your text editing to the next level.
